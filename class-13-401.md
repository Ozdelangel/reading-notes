# Linear Regression In Python

One of the ways to perform Linear Regression is with `scikit-learn`
`Skickit-learn` is a powerful module for machine learning
- it contains function for regression, classification, clustering, model selection and dimensionality reduction.

The first step is always to import the important libraries into whatever you are working on
Maybe assign it to a variable for better access
Then convert it into a panda data frame
Convert the column names into the appropriate feature names
Add the necessary info into your dataframe 

We use linear regression to predict things like in the example the author is using it to predict the Boston housing prices.

The author then imports linear regression via the sci-kit learn module
Then the author stores linear regression into a variable and linear regression is an object
If you want to look inside the linear regression object you can do so by typing `LinearRegression` and then pressing the <tab> key. This will give you a list of functions available inside a linear regression object.

# Important function to keep in mind while fitting a linear regression model are 
Im.fit() fits a linear model
Im.predict -> predict Y using the linear model with estimated coefficients
Im.score() returns the coefficient of determination (R^2). A measure of how well observed outcomes are replicated by the model, as the proportion of total variation of outcomes explained by the model.
You can also explore the functions inside Im object by pressing Im <tab>
.coef_ gives the coefficients and .intercept_ gives the estimated intercepts.
