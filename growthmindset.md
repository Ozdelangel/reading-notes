# The Growth Mindset
What The Growth Mindset means to me is the will to stay in the fight. Never giving up when problems come your way, adapt to a situation, strive to do better. Never being jealous, but be inspired. It reminds of an old quote that my old school wrestling coaches used to preach, it was corny but it is a quote that will stick with me and will always stay with me. 
> “**Good**, **better**, **best**. Never let it rest. Until your good is better and your better is best.”
