# Local Storage
The cons of cookies
- cookies slow down your web application because its transmitting data over and over again
- sending data unencrypted over the internet
- cookies are limited to about 4kb of data
## What We Really Want IS:


- a lot of storage space
on the client
- that persists beyond a page refresh
- isnâ€™t transmitted to the server

## html 5 Storage
- html storage is based on a key/value pair
- you store data based on a named Key
- then you can retrieve the data with the same key
- the data is stored as a string so you have to turn it back to POJO
`POJO`
