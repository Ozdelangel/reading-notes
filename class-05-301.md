# Thinking In React


1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

-A component should only really do one thing, if it changes it should decompose into smaller sub components


2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

- It is something that renders the UI but doesn’t do anything. It is more typing than thinking.

3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
- You need to add all your components and use them. Also, pass data using props.

4.  What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
-  Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
- Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.
 
5. How can you identify where the state needs to live?

- Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
- Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
- Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
- If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
 
# Higher order functions
1. What is a “higher-order function”?

- Functions that use other function that either return them or renders them

2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?

- It is a function that is seeing if M is greater than n and will return the answer

3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.

- It is a function that uses other functions inside to return something.
