# Functions
A `function` is something that takes a input and gives you something in return.

> for example: `function getuserAnswer(){
    let userAnswer = prompt('DO you like MMA?:')
    console.log(userAnswer);`
    
    the function is to get the answer for "do you like MMA". At the end you will have to log it to make it function using `console.log` 

    To call the function we want to invoke the function. there are a few ways to do this; by using code, making a button, or maybe automatically. also, a return function tells it to stop executing and returns value from the function

    Important things to remember
    = assigns value to a function
    + adds numbers & strings
    * multiplies
    / divides
    += adds value to a variable or a string
