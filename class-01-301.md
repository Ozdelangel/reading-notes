# Components

- Makes your Design more thought out and into individual parts
- Makes it so you can find small problems and not have to look in a huge scope
- it Makes things reusable
- increases reliablilty with existing components

## Views of a component

- object oriented view
- conventional view
- process related views

## characteristics of components

- reusable
- replaceable
- independent

## principles of component based design

- the software system decomposed into reusable and cohesive
- components should also extend to other components

# Props

- short for properties 
- it is data that is sent from one component to another
- should not be changed by the child
## using props
1. define the data
2. pass it to the child
3. render the prop data

- props are arguments passed through react

## Things I want to know more about
I Kind of get props but what I'm not sure about is when you pass the prop as an argument in the child component, why cant you just write the code in the parent component? I'm also not sure about the syntax why do you have to change it in the parent and not in the child?
