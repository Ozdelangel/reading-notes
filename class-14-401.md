**MatplotLib**
- First you want to import the library called matplotlib.pyplot as plt
**Plotting lines**
- `Def plot_lines():`
- `plt.figure()`
- Then call the function plot_some_lines()
- It will return the figure size
**Giving your plot some axis**
`X1 = [give it values]`
`X2 = [give it values]`
- Run it again and you should have some lines - - `plt.plot(x1, label=’group spam’)`
- Then you can run more than one line by running the same thing but with your other variable in it
- You often want to use matplotlib on it’s own.

**Seaborn builds on top of matplotlib**
- Import seaborn as sns
- Then run sns.set()
- Seaborn has alot of datasets that seaborn gives us to play around with
- You can see them by running sns.load_dataset?
**Manipulating Data sets with seaborn**
- Remember to read the csv file pd.read_csv(filename)
- You can also narrow down your data example - - `mpg_df[mpg_df.cylinders == 4]`
- You can also group your data together  
- `four_cylinders.groupby(‘origin’, as_index=false).mpg.mean()`
- Then we can bar plot it give everything labels x = whatever, y = label, then give it data example data=mpg_by_origin
- As index = false is needed because matplotlib and seaborn wants it that way
- You can customize your plot in alot of different way. Just choose something that represents you data the right way
- Seaborn likes to work with dataframes
- `sns.relplot(x=”model_year”, y=”mpg”, data=avg_mpg)` 
- X is the x axis and you want it to give it a label
- Y is your y axis on you plot and you give it a label
- Data is what pandas is reading and where your plot is going to get all your info for your plot
