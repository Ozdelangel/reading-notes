# Deploying to Vercel

Create a Vercel Account
First, go to https://vercel.com/signup to create a Vercel account. Choose Continue with GitHub and go through the sign up process.

Import your nextjs-blog repository
Once you’re signed up, import your nextjs-blog repository on Vercel. You can do so from here: https://vercel.com/import/git.

You’ll need to Install Vercel for GitHub. You can give it access to All Repositories.
Once you’ve installed Vercel, import nextjs-blog.
You can use default values for the following settings — no need to change anything. Vercel automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you.

Project Name
Root Directory
Build Command
Output Directory
Development Command
When you deploy, your Next.js app will start building. It should finish in under a minute.
