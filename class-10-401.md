Numpy tutorial
List of list for csv data
First import the csv library
Open the csv file
With the file open create a new csv.reader object
Pass the argument delimiter make sure that the records are split up on the semicolon
Call the list type to get all the rows from the file assign the results to wines
Once we’ve read the data we can print the first three rows
Creating a numpy array
Import the numpy package
Pass the list of lists into the array function which converts it into a numpy array
Exclude the header row with list slicing
Specify the keyword argument dtype to make sure each element is converted to a float
Alternative Numpy Array Creation Methods 
Its useful to create an array with all zero elements in cases when you need an array of fixed size, but don’t have any values for it yet
You can also create an array where each element is a random number using numpy.random.rand
Using numpy to read in files
Use the genfromtxt function to read in the file
Specify the keyword argument delimiter=”:” do the that the files are parsed properly
Specify the keyword argument skip_header=1 do that the header row is skipped
Using Jupyter lab
JupyterLab is a next generation web based user interface for project jupyter
jupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as jupyter notebooks, text editors, terminals, and custom components in a flexible, integrated and extensible manner.
