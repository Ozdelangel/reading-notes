Stacks
Think of a stack of plates and the only way to get the last plate out you have to get rid of the others. So first one in last out
Queue
First in first out 

Every node is going to reference its next node and not its previous just like a linked list
If we do an empty instance the head is going to be set to none
In python we have the ability to traverse through a stack but they are not meant to be traversed. Traditionally you have to remove each node.
A push method is what will add nodes to the stack specifically to the top of the stack
Pop command you donâ€™t pop off the node you pop off the value and store it in memory
Peek just seeing what the node is and closing the stack
is Empty will return true or false if it is empty or not

Pushing to a stack is 0(1) time its instantaneous and it goes straight to the top
Pop is going to be o(1) because we are taking off the top but if we are going for certain node it may be different time

Queue once again first in first out
push/enqueue node or an item that is added
remove/dequeue you dequeue the value not the node
Front is the first node in queue
And rear is the last
Front and rear are going to be on the queue class and not on the node class
