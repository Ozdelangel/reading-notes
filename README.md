## Growth Mindset in my own words

### Above all perseverance

**Knowing there is no challenge too big-** Dont't run from challenges but recognize when you are and think about Growth Mindset as written by Steve Haffenden
>So, lately, I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset.



_Going to work when you really don't want to and_
always trying to put forth your best _effort_ and in the long run it will pay off.


### Three things I will remember the Growth Mindset

- My goals as a student
- My family
- Perseverance
