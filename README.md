## Growth Mindset in my own words

### Above all perseverance

**Knowing there is no challenge too big-** Dont't run from challenges but recognize when you are and think about Growth Mindset as written by Steve Haffenden
>So, lately, I try to recognize that avoidance, take a step back, and think about the growth mindset.



_Going to work when you really don't want to and_
always trying to put forth your best _effort_ and in the long run it will pay off.


### Three things I will use to remember Growth Mindset

- My goals as a student
- My family
- Perseverance

### About me 

I currently live in portland, OR with my wife and daughter. Most of my life I worked in blue collar trades and not really finding a fit. I recently got a huge opportunity to change things around and I chose a path in learning to code. I hope to learn a lot and hopefully do this as career one day.
