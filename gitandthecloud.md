# Notes on Git

snapshots - A distributed version control made of snapshots, so everytime you make changes to something this DVCS will create a snapshot and store reference to it.
Local operations- most neccessary information can be found in local resources so that means your process can be worked on anywhere without being online or having a VPN
Tracking changes - git is always tracking your changes so don't worry, is there is anything that goes wrong in the process it will get found out. alos data loss is very hard because once something is committed git will hold on to all the snapshots of the particular thing you are working on.
