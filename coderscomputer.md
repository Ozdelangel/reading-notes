# Pick the write Text Editor
## a blog post by Osborn Del Angel 
First we need to talk about exactly what a **Text Editor** is. A Text Editor is software that you either download or is already on your computer that writes and manages text.It's a tool that is essential to software developers because you write your code in plain text. When it comes to picking a text editor that is right for you it really comes down to personal preference, and what exactly you want. Every computer comes with a text editor, for example on windows it's called notepad, but when you use notepad its important to know that notepad is the barest of bones of a text editor and it doesn't have the features a software developer might need or want. Some features to look out for in a text editor are code completion, syntax highlighting, a series of themes, or emmett. *Code completion* is important because it gives you possible outcomes of what you're writing and tell you errors about what you're writing, instead of writing it and coming across errors later
*syntax highlighting* is a way to color code your text and it makes it easier to see possible problems because you can seperate the process. *a good series of themes* is important because you don't want to strain your eyes. Most people like a dark background with color text. *Emmett* helps you speed up what you're writing.
