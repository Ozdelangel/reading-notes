# States and Props

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

- Render happens first. The render phase is pure and has no side effects
- may be paused, aborted, or restarted by react


2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
- The very first thing to happen is the mounting phase. 
- When an instance or a component is made it happens during the mounting phase


3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
- componentDidMount
- render, 
- constructor, 
- componentWillUnmount, 
- React Updates 
- Constructor 
- static 
- getDerivedStateFromProps  
- render-React updates  
- componentDidMount 
- UNSAFE_componentWillMount


4. What does componentDidMount do?
- the method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted
- if you need to load anything it should go there
