# Notes

# What are Dunder Methods?
- They are predefined methods to make your classes better
- They start with a double underscore
- They are sometimes called magic methods
# Special Methods and the python data model
- They let devs tap into features such as sequences, iteration, and attribute access
- You can see the data model as a powerful api you can - - - interface by implementing dunder methods
# Object initialization __init__
Takes care of setting up the object
It is a constructor 
Object Representation __str__ and __repr__
Repr is the official string representation of an object
Str the informal string representation
# Iteration __len__ __getitem__, __reversed__
These can iterate
Can help enrich a class
# Probability in Python
When studying data science you will have to learn about probability. Basically what is the chance of an event happening. When we want to calculate this we have to understand what id the probability of this happening.
