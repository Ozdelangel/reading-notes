Graphs

Graphs is a non linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of nodes which may be connected by line segments called edges.

# Need to know terminology

Vertex - is a node that can have zero or more adjacent vertices
Edge - the connection of the two nodes
Neighbor - the neighbor of a node or the nodes that are adjacent
Degree - the degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected

### Undirected graph
This basically means the graph is not instructed to move in any certain direction it can go either way

### Directed graph or a Digraph
This is a graph where every edge is directed. Each node is directed to another node kind of like a linked list

### Complete Graphs
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes

### Connected 
A connected graph is a graph that has all its nodes have atleast on edge

### Disconnected
A graph where some nodes may not have an edge


### Acyclic Graph 
An acyclic graph is a graph without cycles

### Cycle
When a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself

### Cyclic graphs 
Is when it has a cycle and the graph can end up at the same vertex

### Adjacency matrix 
This is represented through a two dimensional array ig there are n vertices then we are lookat an nxn Boolean matrix
