# Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM


## Understanding the problem
- familiarty can take away from the problem domain and make learning easier
- writing code is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. if you take one problem at a time putting together the code or picture is easier.
- understanding the problem is a big part of writing code
- if you can do that it makes thing much easier
- cut out cases and narrow your focus to one part of the problem

## Object Literals
- if a variable is part of an object it is called a property

*property* - properties tell us about the object

- if a function is part of an object it is called a method

*method* - Methods reresent tasks that are associated with an object

*key* - properties and methods have a name and value that is called a *key*

the value of a property can be a string, boolean, and array , or another object.

the value of a method is always a function

## Creating an Object
Literal notaion is the easiest and most popular way to create objects

- the object is the curly braces and their content
-seperate each key from its value by using a colon
- seperate each property and method with a comma. (but not after the last value)
- use the `this` keyword to tell the method you are using the properties of this object
## Acessing an object and DOT notation
- you can access the properties or methods of an object using dot notation
- you can also access properties using square brackets
- to access a property or method of an object you use the name of the object followed by a period
- then the name of the property or method you want to access

## Dom
- Document Object Model

- when a browser loads a page it creates a model
- the model is called a DOM tree
- it has different nodes

### The Document Node
- when you access any element or attribute or text it has to go through the document node 

### Element Node
to access the dom tree you start by looking at elements
- once you find the elements you want then you access all other nodes if you want
