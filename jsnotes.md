# Javascript notes
Imagine a wrist watch on the outside. You see the beautiful numbers, the colors of the watch, or even the gold hands that tell you the time. What you don’t see is all the gears, or programming, or hardware inside that watch. We can compare that to all the languages we’ve learned so far; HTML is the shell of the watch, like how the watch is going to be shaped, how big it is. Then we have CSS: the watch is gold with black hands. Finally, we have JavaScript: we want the time or a working calculator. JavaScript makes websites function and dynamic.

The first Couple days of class we made what is called a *Static Website* which means it doesn’t do much and it’s the same for everybody. As we went on we then learned how to sort of make a *Dynamic Website* which means it will be different for everybody depending on the values put in by the user. It’s kind of like the explore page on whatever social media site you use. Mine is mostly combat sports or shoes, yours could be puppies and food.

In our class and lectures we learned about the different data types of javascript. There are a alot of data types but in code 102, we learned about three. First, there is a data type called strings `”hello world”` or `”hello world”`. Second, we used numbers in javascript so if you put two numbers together it will tell you the value. Last, we used booleans which is basically a true or false.
