# Forms

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?


1. a Controlled component is where a form can render, but also control what happens with the user subsequent information put there by the user.

2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- it should update as soon as the user types
- the input value is always driven by the React state

3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
you would 

`event.target.value`

# Ternary Statements

1. we should use a ternary opterator becuase you can:
- type it one line
- better way for an if else statement

2. rewrite this if/else statment using a ternary operator;
  `if(x===y){
 console.log(true);
  } else {
 console.log(false);
  }`

  `xandy = ((x===y)? true:false)`
