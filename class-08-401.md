List Comprehension in python

List comprehension is a powerful and concise method for creating lists in python that becomes essential the more you work with lists and lists of lists

Three essential things that makes a list essential
My_new_list = [expression for item in list]
First is the expression we’d like to carry out
Second is the object that expression will work on
Last we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. 

A simple explanation is you’re going to perform an expression on each item in the list. The expression will determine what item is eventually store in the output list

Create a list with range
# construct a basic list using range() and list comprehension syntax
Digits = [x for x in range(10)]

So were using the range method to generate a list of numbers then we iterate through each item in that range and saves a copy of the item in a new list called digits

List comprehension is a faster way to iterate and through the expression do something to the list instead of having an empty on and then looping and then appending it to the list

Multiplying parts of a list 

Even_numbers = [ x for x in range(1,20) if x % 2 == 0]

So this is going to iterate through number 1-19 and only multiply the ones that are divisible by 2 with no remainder so basically even numbers

You can do to the same thing with strings also
