Using Pandas
Adding a set to kaggle you are going to add data and search for video game sales and then press add and it will import a whatever.csv
Csv comma separated values
Then set a variable of filename = path of what you imported 
Df means data frame df = pd.read.csv(filename) this will let us read the file we will import in
To test if it worked on the data frame you can run info df.info()
df.head() looks at the top five items by default
To look at the top fifteen you can give head an argument df.head(15)
To look at the bottom of the list you can run df.tail() you can also pass in an argument
Filtering Down Data
You can run df[‘name’] to filter out by name
You can filter out by anything you want if it’s in the data
So to manipulate the data even more like if you wanted the top 15 names
df.[‘name’].head(15)
To manipulate even more say you wanted to learn about multiple items
You can run df[‘name’,’calories’] but make sure to add another set of brackets
To filter even more you can run df[[‘name’,’calories’]].tail(15)
You can also set and index df.set_index(‘name’) and this will sort by name instead of the number that is given
To filter out your search even more you can run df[[‘name’,’rating’,’calories’]].sort_values(‘rating”)
Mean, median, mode, and range
Mean to find the average of something
Example avg_cal= df[‘calories’].mean()
Avg.cal
Median
Example: med_cal = df[‘calories’].median()
Med_cal
Comparing data
Example: to see the calories are greater than avg.cal
Df[df[‘calories’] > avg.cal][[name, calories]]sort.values(calories)
Standard deviation
Find out how far something is from the norm
df[‘calories’].std()
