# Wireframing/HTML notes

Wireframing is a process that designers use to make a general outline of what they want a site to look like. The look, the functionality, information achitecture. Even though you can download software that can help you with this process, you can also just use simple pen and paper. 

Remember to also do your research or as comedians like to say "read the room". Who is going to be looking at this? what information should be most prominent? are all questions you should be asking yourself while you build this frame. iformation achitecure is very important. Also, keep a dang cheat sheet and keep your ideas uncluttered.

wireframin is a process within a process. so, before anything you do goes live, you want multiple different drafts. Something that I will keep in mind is always going to be: Idea on paper, add a little detail, test. 

Next comes the prototype phase where should probably use some software like figma, which is in browser!
